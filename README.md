## hoc-tutorial: Higher-Order Component (HOC) Modal Demo

hoc-tutorial is a minimalist React application designed to showcase the power and versatility of Higher-Order Components (HOCs). The app demonstrates how HOCs can efficiently add modal functionality to different pages without sharing state between them.

### Purpose
The purpose of hoc-tutorial is to provide a practical example of implementing Higher-Order Components in a React application. It aims to demonstrate how HOCs can help avoid code repetition and enable the use of a shared modal component across different pages.

### Features
ðŸ”¹ Two Pages with Modal: The app features two pages, each equipped with a button that opens the same modal. Both pages are wrapped in the same HOC to enable the modal functionality.  
ðŸ”¹ Reusable HOC: The Higher-Order Component (HOC) used in hoc-tutorial can be applied to any component, providing them with modal capabilities. This ensures easy reusability throughout the application.

### How to Use
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:   
  ```git clone https://github.com/domjoeymoncada/hoc-tutorial```
